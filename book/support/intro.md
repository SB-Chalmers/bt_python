# Supporting Python Projects (for Supervisors & Leads)

This section is designed to help senior researchers, supervisors, and project leads better support research workflows that rely on Python — even if they don’t write code themselves. Supporting Python-based projects can dramatically improve the quality, reproducibility, and long-term impact of research.

## Why Senior Researchers Should Support Python Workflows

Python is one of the most widely used tools in research today — for working with data, automating tasks, simulating systems, and creating reproducible outputs. But while many researchers learn Python on their own, they often lack structured support from supervisors or project leads.

Your support can:
- **Reduce technical debt** by encouraging reusable and documented code
- **Accelerate onboarding** of students and collaborators
- **Improve reproducibility** and open-science readiness
- **Ensure resource allocation** (time, people, storage, infrastructure) for tech work

You don’t need to be a coder — just being aware of what's needed makes you a better research leader.
