## Reviewing Python-Based Research (Without Being a Coder)

You can still meaningfully review and guide Python-based work by asking:

### 🔍 Key Review Questions
- [ ] Is there a clear README and explanation of the purpose?
- [ ] Can I understand inputs and outputs without reading code?
- [ ] Is the data documented and structured?
- [ ] Would someone else be able to rerun or extend the work?

### 🧭 Suggestions for Non-Coders
- Ask the student or RA to walk through the code live
- Request a visual flowchart of the workflow (input → processing → output)
- Check if folders are structured and named meaningfully
- Look for evidence of collaboration (e.g. Git commit history, docstrings, issues tracked)
