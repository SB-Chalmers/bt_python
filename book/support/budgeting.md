Time and support for Python work are often underestimated. Encourage project teams to:

### ðŸ§¾ Budget Time
- [ ] Allocate 40â€“60% of time for data wrangling and cleaning
- [ ] Allocate time for code review, refactoring, and documentation
- [ ] Leave time for testing and walkthroughs of the codebase

### ðŸ§  Budget Roles
- [ ] Assign research assistants or RSEs for technical support
- [ ] Include co-supervisors with data or coding expertise

### ðŸ’» Budget Tools
- [ ] Storage (Dropbox, GitHub, S3)
- [ ] Compute (HPC, cloud)
- [ ] Version control (GitHub/GitLab)
