## Scoping Python in a Research Project

Before anyone starts writing code, guide the project team in scoping how Python fits in:

### 🔍 Define Purpose
- Are we exploring data?
- Automating a repetitive task?
- Building a long-term reusable tool?

### 🎯 Define Level of Ambition
- Quick task (clean one dataset)?
- Reusable pipeline for team use?
- Fully reproducible paper with open repo?

### 👥 Define Roles
- Who is writing the code?
- Who reviews, documents, maintains it?
- Are we building technical capacity (e.g. training an RA)?

### 📝 Checklist for Scoping
- [ ] What is the purpose of using Python in this project?
- [ ] What kind of outputs are expected (plots, tables, scripts, models)?
- [ ] What data is needed, and in what format?
- [ ] Do we expect the code to be reused? Published?
- [ ] Who is responsible for technical infrastructure (e.g. environments, storage)?
