## Summary
Supporting Python-based research isn't about knowing every command — it's about enabling good workflows, allocating time, and asking the right questions. You can:

✅ Scope technical ambition realistically  
✅ Support clean and structured data  
✅ Encourage modular, documented code  
✅ Budget time and staff for infrastructure work  
✅ Advocate for code as a research output

You’re not just supervising research — you’re shaping how research gets done.
